- Familiarize themselves with the ranking system and team levels (combined into one page),
- Purchase drone upgrades,
- Study investment strategies, coverage geography, and technical support,
- Manage their account, including viewing transaction history,
- And also register, log in, and recover their password.

All descriptions are provided in maximum detail, without a todo list, but with specific instructions to simplify implementation.
